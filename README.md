Plots cell cycle
Finds markers within each first drug object to look for subgroups
Builds filtered_meta Idents to say if each cell is in resistant, large resistant, or filtered lineages 
Plots expression of egfr/ngfr per lineage >5 cells over time in dabtram as violin
Highlights cells in UMAP space in switching vs stable lineages
Finds egfr/ngfr score per lineage over time in dabtram, plots as heatmap
	Identifies how these lineages grow in other drugs after dabtram as well
Assesses whether cells from the same lineage are more likely to be in the same cluster than by random changce for each drug condition
	Plots the test statistics
Plots the DabTram both times object and overlays EGFR and NGFR expression
Identifies which clusters have lineages with only a single cell in them (singlets)
Code takes a very long time to run, so also saves worksapce for loading everything back in to R
Looks into different cisplatin resistant cell clusters to try to understant why there is one massive cluster/what is special about this cluster. Compares to cisplatin-to-cisplatin. 
Plots all of the different UMAPs individually for supplemental figure
